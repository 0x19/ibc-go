# Making an IBC Enabled Counter Smart Contract

In the following sections, we will create a simple IBC enabled smart contract which expects to be deployed on two chains that will count the number of times it receives ibc messages. This tutorial is based on the [Cosmwasm IBC Example](https://github.com/0xekez/cw-ibc-example/tree/main) repository, much thanks to [0xekez](https://github.com/0xekez) for the original work.
